## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI builds a docker image from a Dockerfile and then installs dependencies defined in `hello_world/requirements.txt` inside the docker image. The processed template file is saved in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```



## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and run unit tests from your local machine.

```bash
$ pip install pytest pytest-mock --user
$ python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name ux-simulator
```
